# Global Economic Scorecard: Time Series Forecasting with Holt-Winters and ARIMA models

## Overview
Within this project, an elaborate statistical and visual exploration of global economic trends was conducted using data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. The goal was to uncover patterns and relationships in economic indicators across various countries and continents.

## Objectives
- Investigate the global impact of governance on economic prosperity.
- Explore the interconnectedness of trade balance and economic health.
- Examine the relationship between labor force, unemployment rates, and GDP growth.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises economic indicators sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI), spanning the years 2008 to 2022. The chosen variables represent key aspects of economic development, ranging from inflation and GDP growth to indicators of political stability and trade balances. 

With over 345 instances and 19 input features across 23 countries, four continents and 15 years, the dataset was central to unveiling valuable insights that could be used to empower socio-economic initiatives.

## Methodology and Tools
- Comprehensive statistical analysis using R.
- Interactive dashboard design using PowerBI.
- Techniques include Exploratory Data Analysis, Correlation Analysis, Regression Analysis, and Time Series Analysis.


## Applied Statistical Methods and Concepts
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and data type conversions.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics for a initial understanding of the data semantics.
- **Data Visualization**: Use of `ggplot2` and `gplots` for a comprehensive visual exploration of economic trends across each continent.
- **Outlier Detection and Handling**: Identification of outliers in economic indicators.
- **Normality Testing**: Application of the Shapiro-Wilk test and visual checks.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Spearman correlation to explore relationships between variables.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducted elaborate fact checkings (hypothesis tests) using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- **Regression Analysis**: Implemented Simple, Multiple and Polynomial Linear Regression models.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Forecasting with Holt-Winters and ARIMA models.

## Findings
The study shed some light on how governance, trade, and labor market conditions affect economic prosperity. The research also showed how these factors differ across different continents and how they have evolved over time, uncovering meaningful connections between the economic indicators and providing a background for predicting future trends.


## Dashboard Reporting with PowerBI
Ultimately, this project required the development of an interactive dashboard using PowerBI to visualize the story. The dashboard displayed economic indicators and their trends over time, providing a user-friendly way to explore the complex data patterns. The dashboard was shared with stakeholders for collaborative analysis, providing valuable insights in a visually appealing and accessible format.
